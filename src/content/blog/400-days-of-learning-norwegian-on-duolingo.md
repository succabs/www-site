This is the story of my great achievement: I finally hit the 400-day mark on Duolingo! Read on to discover what I’ve learned during this time and how this journey has shaped my perspective.

## Why Norwegian?

Norwegian wasn't just a random choice for me—it was a deliberate decision influenced by several factors:

- **A Rich Country**: Norway is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, known for its high standard of living and strong economy.
- **Great Music**: I’ve always been a fan of Norwegian music, especially metal and electronic artists like Röyksopp.
- **Cultural Similarities**: As a Finn, I find Norwegians culturally similar to us. It feels like a natural extension of my own culture.
- **Fantasies of Moving**: Sometimes, I fantasize about moving to Norway, and learning the language seemed like a good first step.

## The Journey Begins

My journey with Norwegian started with a realization: the basics of the language seemed approachable, especially since I had learned Swedish in school. Norwegian and Swedish are quite similar, at least at a foundational level, which gave me a bit of a head start.

### My Learning Schedule

Consistency was key. I committed to practicing 5-10 minutes daily, usually squeezing in a session before brushing my teeth and going to bed. Additionally, I supplemented my Duolingo exercises with podcasts about learning Norwegian and life in Norway, which provided valuable context and kept me motivated.

### Milestones and Challenges

Reaching 400 days wasn’t without its hurdles:

- **Maintaining the Streak**: There were days when I struggled to find the time to continue my streak, but fortunately, Duolingo offers streak freezes, which were a lifesaver on more than one occasion.
- **The Numbers Dilemma**: One of the most frustrating aspects was Duolingo's difficulty with spoken numbers. Exercises involving numbers often felt cumbersome and less effective.
- **Temptation to Switch**: At times, I considered switching to another language, but I decided to stick with Norwegian, knowing that persistence is key in language learning.

### Progress and Achievements

Despite the challenges, there were several highlights along the way:

- **Streak Satisfaction**: Watching my streak grow day by day was incredibly satisfying and kept me coming back for more.
- **Gamification**: I enjoyed the gamified elements of Duolingo, which made the learning process fun and engaging.
- **30,000 XP Milestone**: I’ve accumulated around 30,000 XP in the Norwegian course—a testament to my dedication.
- **Monthly Badges**: I’ve earned all the monthly badges, completing 50 daily quests each month to achieve this.

## What Have I Learned?

After 400 days, I’ve gained a decent understanding of the basics:

- **Foundational Vocabulary**: I can confidently use traveling words, discuss life and family, and engage in basic conversations.
- **Media Comprehension**: I’ve started to pick up on words and phrases while watching Norwegian shows, which feels like a small but significant victory.

### Key Takeaways

Language learning is a marathon, not a sprint. While I’ve only scratched the surface of Norwegian, the journey has taught me patience, consistency, and the importance of setting small, achievable goals.

## Looking Ahead

My journey with Norwegian is far from over. I plan to continue my daily practice and hope to visit Norway in the coming years. There’s nothing quite like testing your language skills in real-life situations, and I look forward to that challenge. 

Here’s to the next 400 days—and beyond!
