This is the story of an achievement I have quietly done over the year: I finally hit the 365-day streak on Duolingo! Read on to discover what I’ve learned during this time and how this journey has shaped my perspective.

## Why Norwegian?

Norwegian wasn't just a random choice for me—it was a deliberate decision influenced by several factors:

- **A Rich Country**: Norway is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, known for its high standard of living and strong economy.
- **Great Music**: I’ve always been a fan of Norwegian music, especially metal and electronic artists like Röyksopp.
- **Cultural Similarities**: As a Finn, I find Norwegians culturally similar to us. It feels like a natural extension of my own culture.
- **Fantasies of Moving**: Sometimes, I fantasize about moving to Norway, and learning the language seemed like a good first step.

## The Journey Begins

My journey with Norwegian started with a realization: the basics of the language seemed approachable, especially since I had learned Swedish in school. Norwegian and Swedish are quite similar, at least at a foundational level, which gave me a bit of a head start.

### My Learning Schedule

Consistency was key. I committed to practicing 5-10 minutes daily, usually squeezing in a session before brushing my teeth and going to bed. Additionally, I supplemented my Duolingo exercises with podcasts about learning Norwegian and life in Norway, which provided valuable context and kept me motivated.

### Challenges

Reaching 365 days wasn’t without its hurdles:

- **Maintaining the Streak**: There were days when I struggled to find the time to continue my streak, but fortunately, Duolingo offers streak freezes, which were a lifesaver on more than one occasion.
- **The Numbers - THE NUMBERS!!**: One of the most frustrating aspects was Duolingo's difficulty with spoken numbers.  It simply can't understand numbers in speaking exercises. That made exercises involving numbers often felt cumbersome and less effective.
- **Temptation to Switch**: At times, I considered switching to another language, but I decided to stick with Norwegian, knowing that persistence is key in language learning.

### Progress and Achievements

Despite the challenges, there were several highlights along the way:

- **Streak Satisfaction**: Watching my streak grow day by day was incredibly satisfying and kept me coming back for more.
- **Gamification**: I enjoyed the gamified elements of Duolingo, which made the learning process fun and engaging.
- **30,000 XP Milestone**: I’ve accumulated around 30,000 XP in the Norwegian course—a testament to my dedication.
- **Monthly Badges**: I’ve earned all the monthly badges, completing 50 daily quests each month to achieve this.

## What Have I Learned?

After 365 days, I’ve gained a decent understanding of the basics:

- **Foundational Vocabulary**: I can confidently use traveling words, discuss life and family, and engage in basic conversations.
- **Media Comprehension**: I’ve started to pick up on words and phrases while watching Norwegian shows, which feels like a small but significant victory.

However, Duolingo alone only covers the basics. To gain a deeper understanding, better vocabulary and fluency, it’s essential to supplement with additional learning methods, such as consuming Norwegian media (series, movies, news) and engaging in real-life conversations.

### Key Takeaways

Language learning is a marathon, not a sprint. While I’ve only scratched the surface of Norwegian, the journey has taught me patience, consistency, and the importance of setting small, achievable goals.

## Looking Ahead

My journey with Norwegian is far from over. I plan to continue my daily practice and hope to visit Norway in the coming years. There’s nothing quite like testing your language skills in real-life situations, and I look forward to that challenge. 

This is actually a post I wrote over a month ago but publishing now - my current streak is 404. No, not the "not found" error message - streak is still going strong with 404 days :)
