This isn’t just about learning a language; it’s about chasing dreams of fjords, Röyksopp, and maybe even a new life in Norway. Come for the insights, stay for the chaos."

# **What's Happened?**

Here’s something I’ve quietly been grinding away at for a year: I finally hit a 365-day streak on Duolingo! That’s right—a full year of daily Norwegian practice. This post is a look at what I’ve learned, the challenges I’ve faced, and how this journey has shaped my perspective on language learning (and maybe life a little, too).

## **Why Norwegian?**

This wasn’t some random spin-the-wheel-of-languages decision. Learning Norwegian was a deliberate choice, and here’s why:  

- **A Wealthy, Happy Place**: Norway ranks among the richest countries in the world, and its high standard of living has a strong appeal. Plus, let’s be real—who doesn’t daydream about fjords and hygge?  
- **The Music Scene**: I’m a huge fan of Norwegian artists, especially Röyksopp and some of their more metal compatriots.  
- **Cultural Vibes**: As a Finn, I’ve always felt a kinship with Norwegians. There’s something about their humor, values, and general vibe that feels… familiar.  
- **Future Plans?**: I occasionally fantasize about moving to Norway. Learning the language seemed like the natural first step toward that pipe dream.

## **The Journey Begins**

Norwegian wasn’t completely foreign to me when I started—having learned Swedish in school gave me a bit of a head start. As a Finn, it’s mandatory to study both English and Swedish, and I even dabbled in German for a couple of years. Norwegian, being so similar to Swedish, felt approachable and logical to tackle.

### **Daily Practice Ritual**  

Consistency was the secret sauce. I dedicated 5–10 minutes a day, often squeezing in a lesson right before brushing my teeth. Over time, I also added podcasts about Norwegian culture and life, which kept me inspired and helped connect language to context.

## **Challenges on the Road to 365**

No streak is without its bumps, and mine was no exception.  

### **1. The Streak Struggle**  
Life happens. There were days when squeezing in a lesson felt impossible, but streak freezes on Duolingo saved me from losing my progress on multiple occasions. They’re both a blessing and a crutch.  

### **2. Numbers, Numbers Everywhere**  
One major gripe? Duolingo’s voice recognition system *hates* numbers. Speaking exercises involving numbers became an exercise in frustration. I’d pronounce them correctly (or so I thought), and the app would respond like I’d just made up a word.  

### **3. The Grass Is Always Greener**  
There were moments when I was tempted to abandon Norwegian and start a shiny new language. But sticking with it has been a lesson in discipline—and a reminder that hopping languages is the quickest path to learning… nothing.

## **Progress and Achievements**  

Despite the hurdles, I’ve got some victories worth celebrating:  

- **That Streak, Though**: Watching my streak grow from days to weeks to months was immensely satisfying. Gamification works, people.  
- **Leveling Up**: I’ve racked up over 30,000 XP in Norwegian—a testament to showing up daily, even when it felt like a chore.  
- **All the Badges**: Duolingo’s monthly quests became a mini-obsession. Completing 50 daily challenges each month was a grind, but I nailed it.  
- **Media Wins**: I’ve started picking out familiar words and phrases in Norwegian shows, which feels like unlocking a secret cheat code.

## **What Did I Actually Learn?**  

A year later, I’ve built a solid foundation in Norwegian:  

- **Basic Vocabulary**: I can navigate travel scenarios, discuss family, and hold simple conversations without sounding like a complete idiot.  
- **Media Skills**: Picking up phrases in Norwegian TV shows and music has been one of the most rewarding aspects of the journey.  

But let’s be real—Duolingo alone won’t make you fluent. To go deeper, I’ll need to dive into more immersive methods like watching movies, reading books, and (gulp) speaking with actual Norwegians.

## **What’s Next?**

This isn’t the end of my Norwegian journey. I’m still on track, with my streak currently standing at a very satisfying 404 days (Not a “Not Found” error—this streak is alive and kicking!). In case you didn't realize it from the last sentence, the title of the post is a lie. I meant to write this after 365 days but here we are. 404 seems like a proper number for a developer, anyway.

My next goals:  

1. **More Immersion**: Watching more Norwegian TV and reading simple books to expand vocabulary.  
2. **Real Conversations**: Tackling the scary-but-rewarding task of talking to actual Norwegians.  
3. **A Trip to Norway**: Testing my skills in the wild is the ultimate challenge—and hopefully, a not-too-distant reality.

## **Final Thoughts**

Learning a language is like climbing a mountain—it’s slow, sometimes painful, and full of moments where you wonder why you even started. But every step is worth it. This 365-day journey has taught me more than just Norwegian. It’s reminded me of the value of patience, persistence, and celebrating small wins along the way.  

So here’s to the next 365 (404) days—and hopefully, a conversation with a Norwegian that doesn’t involve me asking them to speak slower.
